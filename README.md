## Description

I developed a Python-based order system for a takeout restaurant named Galactic Grub Grab, designed with accessibility in mind for customers, particularly those with hearing and vocal impairments. This is a fully interactive ordering experience where customers can select menu items, specify quantities, and receive a detailed receipt. The core functionalities to be implemented include displaying the menu, processing orders, and generating a receipt, all while ensuring the system is intuitive and error-tolerant.

## Installation

Install the latest version of Python and run the file order_system.py

  

## Usage
User Experience and Accessibility:

Aimed at individuals who might find traditional ordering methods challenging due to hearing or vocal impairments, this system allows for complete independence in placing an order. Upon starting the program, users see all available menu items with their categories, names, and prices. They can add items to their order by inputting numbers, select quantities, and decide whether to continue ordering or finalize their purchase.

  

## Learning Points

The project required modifications to three main functions in the code: place_order(), update_order(), and print_itemized_receipt(). These functions handle the user's journey from viewing the menu to finalizing their order. The menu data is stored in dictionaries, allowing for easy access and manipulation of menu items. Python's features like conditionals for decision making, loops for iterative processes, and list comprehensions for efficient data handling are employed. The system accommodates potential user errors by providing defaults or error messages, ensuring a smooth user experience.
